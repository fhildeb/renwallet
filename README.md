# Prototype Tokenizing Wallet

## Introduction

This project is an prototype how Bitcoin can be tokenized on Ethereum. It can be executed in modern browsers which are connected to MetaMask on the Kovan testnet. [RenProject](https://renproject.io) is used for tokenizing.

RenProject offers two ways of usage: **GatewayJS** and **RenJS**. While the Gateway is used to grant easy access into the technology featuring expanded caching and a prebuild frontend overlay, it not the best option for developers who want to integrate the technology in lightway wallets with few overhead. Therefore, RenProject offers a light standard version called RenJS, which features the bare minimum to introduce the thechnology and is also used within this wallet.

Guides used to integrate software:

- [RenProject Developer Docs](https://docs.renproject.io/developers/)
- [MetaMask Developer Docs](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/)
- [ReactJS Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Programming Languages:

- Solidity (Smart Contract)
- JavaScript (Browser Wallet)

Script Languages:

- HTML (React Rendering)
- CSS (Formatting/Animation)

The Application is now running at
`localhost:3000`

To stop the Application use `Ctrl+C` in Terminal

## Avalable Developer Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
